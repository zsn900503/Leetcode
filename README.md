"# Leetcode" 

Cited from the website
"LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. Pick from an expanding library of more than 450 questions, code and submit your solution to see if you have solved it correctly. It is that easy!

Our platform currently supports a total of 11 languages: C, C++, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, Ruby, Swift, Go, Bash, MySQL."

I'll keep updating solutions (mainly in c++) in the following days.
